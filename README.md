# VNSRR
This repo includes code to implement Variable Neighborhood Searching Rerandomization(VNSRR) and reproduce the numerical experiments.

The files with index from 1a to 1e generate the data in the simulation studies.

The files with index from 2a to 2g apply VNSRR and the competing methods to the simulated data.

The files with index from 3a to 3b analyzes the real dataset.

The files whose file names start with 'rerand' implements VNSRR and the competing methods in different types of randomized experiments.

The files within the folder 'chart' summarize the simulation results and compare the performances of different methods.
